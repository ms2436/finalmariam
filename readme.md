# MSTU 5003 Design Document - FINAL PROJECT

For the mid-term I created a web site to help drivers prepare for winter weather conditions. For the final project, I decided to focus on a few areas that needed development: overall look and feel, assessment tools, keeping materials in the website and improving the navigation bar/ overall navigation of the site. As the snowy season approaches, drivers must prepare themselves and their cars for dangerous road conditions.  This website, Winter Warriors, is geared towards safety-conscious drivers who live in cold weather climates.  There are four major components of the web site: home page with pre-assessment, learning page with videos and checklist, formative assessment game, and resources.  Web site users can explore each of these areas individually or use the entire site to build a bank of knowledge that can be tested before they begin or after they learn the materials.   The home page will welcome users to the site and offer a brief overview of what is offered on Winter Warriors as well as a pre-test.  The Learn link offers videos and checklists on how to prepare a car for the winter season, how to create or buy a survival kit for your car, and what to do in case of an emergency.  The mid-term version separated the content by topic, but for this version I decided to separate it by Video and Checklist. Once the user has completed the Learn link, they can take the "Make a Kit" to see if they are a Winter Warrior. This game checks to see if users are able to choose the correct items to make a car survival kit. The final part of the site is the extended resources. I also rearranged these materials to be consistent with the learning link.  The materials on this page consist of stories of people who survived bad weather conditions in their cars, things you can do at home when bad weather hits, and lists of the safest All-Wheel Drive vehicles for inclement weather.

## Topic
The main topic of the Winter Warriors site is how to prepare yourself and your car for winter weather driving conditions.  It is a specific topic that users can revisit on a yearly basis. In addition to preparing the physical car, the site offers information on how to be prepared in case of an emergency.  There is information on what a driver should have inside the car (ie a survival kit).  Information is also offered on what to do in case of an emergency and how to survive the worse case scenario.  
The site is not for teaching driving - it is for preparing drivers for winter.
The broader field this applies to is driver education and driver safety.  It is also a regional issue as not areas of the country are affected by extreme winter weather which requires car preparation.

## Problem
Many accidents occur because cars are not properly winterized each year.  Also, people can be stranded in their cars without adequate survival equipment.  These are serious problems when you live in cold climates.  By having the knowledge and understanding on how to prepare yourself and your car for extreme cold weather, you will be better prepared for the winter months and be a more confident driver.  This is also useful for people who are visiting or moving to cold climates and do not have background knowledge on how to deal with changing seasons. Drivers do not realize the many factors involved in preparing themselves and their vehicles for winter.  They may also overlook the importance of preparing for the worst case scenario.
I separated the materials in the finals version in order to allow users flexibility to choose the way they wanted to learn.

## Target Audience
The site reach residents of cold climates who wish to prepare their vehicles for wintertime. Whether they are looking for a quick checklist or would like to learn a more in-depth method of preparation, the site will accommodate their needs.  In addition to the lifelong residents of cold climates, our audience will also be drivers who are new to cold climates and need to learn what it takes to be prepared for winter including the risks of the road. The site can also be used by visitors to cold regions and new drivers. The site is useful to drivers of all ages and experience level.

### User Stories

- **User Story 1:  Elizabeth Ruiz, age 19, Boston, MA: I am moving to New England to attend college in the fall. As a lifelong resident of Washington DC, I have driven in snow but never really lived in an area where blizzards and extreme weather are a way of life.  I need to learn how to prepare my car and myself for this first real winter season.  I usually just have a spare tire in the car and that's it.  I need to get a survival kit ready and find if there's anything else I should be doing.  My parents will come to visit me in the fall and I want to be sure that I can show them how prepared I am. I have googled a few videos but there's a lot information out there and I really have no idea what is reliable.  I don't want to make any mistakes and need to be safe about winter driving.

- **User Story 2: Lisa Hadid, Rochester, NY age 32:  I grew up in upstate New York and I know a lot about about winterizing a car, but this is my first year as a mom. I am quite nervous about what to do if I get stuck in a snowstorm with my little son. My husband works far from home so even if I were able to contact him, he may not be able to come get us right away.  I wonder if it's safe to drive with snow on the ground at all.  What can I do if I get stuck in a blizzard?  I need to have special supplies in my car in case I get stuck but I don't remember what they are anymore.  I need a quick site I can visit while my kid is taking a nap.

- **User Story 3: Greg Portman, Minneapolis, MN, age 50:  I travel for work at least 45 minutes a day and my car isn't in the best shape.  I am saving to buy a new one but until I can afford it I need to be sure I can survive with what I have.  I know some tips after living here all these years but I need to be sure that I have got all the bases covered especially with the car I have and the amount I have to drive. I wonder how to get tips on which car to get next for this weather.  

- **User Story 4: Aron Karg, Atlanta, GA, age 45:  I am going to take a road trip this weekend and need to be sure the car is ready for the journey.  The weather report isn't that promising but we have to go to a funeral so we are preparing the car and ourselves for a 4 hour trip.   What can we do to pack the car just in case something goes wrong and also what can we do to get the car ready in advance?  I need a quick checklist because we are leaving in 48 hours.


## Strategy
### Site Objectives:

My objective is to deliver informational content in an interesting way that lets users know the topic is serious.  I also want users to be able to digest the information quickly so have chosen clips under 5 minutes each and checklists that are not too difficult to read and comprehend.  The formative assessment is not the point of the site so I changed it from a quiz to a more interactive game-like option.

The objective of the site is the offer an efficient way for drivers to receive information and incorporate it into their lives.  I will deliver it through a multi-modal approach that allows users to absorb information at their pace.

### Success Metrics

There is a pre-assessment assessment offered on the homepage that users can take before or after they use the site. This quiz feature will show the percentage of correct answers and will also show the actual correct answers. There is also a weblink for users who wish to test the information retention called "Make a Kit".  This gamelike feature lets users choose 4 out of 5 items that belong in the car kit.


## Scope
The home page will welcome users to the site and offer a brief overview of what is offered on Winter Warriors.  There is also a pre-test on this page. Users will link via button directly to the Learn page.  There is also a nav bar on all pages, including checklists and game, which links to every page.  The Learn link offers 2 components: videos and checklist.  Within these two areas are the content of the site: "How to prepare your car"(deals with how to prepare a car for the winter season), "How to prepare yourself" (how to create or buy a survival kit for your car) and "In case of Emergency". Once the user has completed the Learn link, they can attempt to "Make a Kit" by clicking on the button or nav bar link. This game allows users to pick 4 of the 5 items that could be used to make a car survival kit.  They can learn about this by reading the checklist or watching the video.  Ideally I would make another game for other content area as well. The final part of the site is the extended resources.  The format of the Resources is like that of the Learning Link. There are three components within the area of videos and checklists.  These Resource components consist of "Tales of Survival" (stories of people who survived bad weather conditions in their cars), "Things to do at home when it's snowing" (things you can do at home when bad weather hits), and "Best AWD Cars" (lists of the safest All-Wheel Drive vehicles for inclement weather).

## Structure
The website will have a clear and unembellished look to it.  I have used winter colors such as white, winter blue and gray.  I moved to a vertical box structure when incorporating video and images on the Learn and Resources link for a uniform look.  The Home page has a more serious tone to match the subject matter.  It is a very fluid navigation that makes for quick and easy to follow usage.
