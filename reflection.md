Proposal and Reflection
Proposal
For my final there are three major areas of improvement I would like to focus on.  I would like to develop the curriculum more and rely less on external sites and materials.  I would like to make the site navigation more detailed and I would like to develop a more interactive quiz.  In order to improve the curriculum, I will focus on the resources and learning pages and create my own docs for the checklists.  I also want to be sure that the pages have a very similar look.  I will also embed all of the videos within the site as well with a some slides or other materials for viewers.  Once I develop the curriculum I would like to organize the nav bar in a way that helps users have a more organized experience, through the use of a drop down or hover bar.  For the assessment, I would like to use a “build a kit” kind of game using Javascript.  I think this is a more useful assessment for users.

Reflection
When I was putting the midterm website together I really focused on making a scalable project. I balanced my time between the project design and the web design component.  I spent a lot of time choosing the right components for the project the first time around. For the final project, however, I did not have to spend time on the topic and was able to focus all of my attention on the design details.  

I went into the project with a few goals in mind.  I wanted to improve the look of my homepage because it lacked polish.  I also wanted to make the pre-test more formal and the post-test more informal.  This would require JavaScript and creating an entirely new game-like feature for posttest.  As I rearranged the pages, I also added color to the links to make them feel more connected to the homepage.  As I was doing this, I realized how much goes into every aspect of a site.  Just choosing a color for the sub-head font took me 20 minutes!  

This time around I also used a css styles page and it made my life so much easier.  For the midterm assignment I relied completely on bootstrap and line item styling. This time around, I used both Jquery, bootstrap and css. It took a while for me to get comfortable with this but it was worth it.

I really like the improvements to the site and think the user experience is better than the midterm.
